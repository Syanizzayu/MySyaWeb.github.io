        <h2>Part-time worker at Watsons</h2>
        <p>
 	As a part-time worker at Watson, I have been working with dedication even though I faced a lot of obstacles. For me, that is not a reason why I need to hate my job. I have been working for two months part-time before pursuing my education journey. My job scope is customer service, where I need to serve and fulfill the needs of customers. It is not that easy to handle a lot of people and different attitudes for each of them. Other than that, without realizing it, my communication skills have improved since I talk with many customers.
